# PainfulTest
2d top down game.

# Note 1
I didn't get to code the heavy shoot feature. I did the ship shoot to the right, but only one bullet, not three parallels. Please note that the Bullets For Heavy Attack parameter on enemy ship, are set to 1, if you change it to 3 it won't work when the ship position is on horizontal, only in vertical.

# Note 2
For some reason the Game Event system that I made, when an event is called, sometimes shows "null references" error messages after we change some parameters on editor (it doesn't seems to be any one in specific). To solve the error, change the scene to another (game to menu or menu to game). Seems like a editor bug or something.
